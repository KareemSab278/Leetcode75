I have decided to stop doing leetcode for a while.

It is sad that i had to stop because of the limitations of my knowledge, and this seriously hurt my ego.

For now, im going to spend as much of my waking hours learning advanced DSA so i can get a stronger foundation of how to solve leetcode problems and ultimately pass interview questions.

I also want to learn this stuff because it would make me a much better developer, even though using them in a developer job is like seeing unicorns.

It is always good to know how to write more efficient and powerful code.

for the next few months, Ill be learning and come back stronger.
